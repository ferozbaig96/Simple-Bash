[] vs. [[]]


Contrary to [, [[ prevents word splitting of variable values. So, if
VAR="var with spaces",
you do not need to double quote $VAR in a test - eventhough using quotes remains a good habit.

Also, [[ prevents pathname expansion, so literal strings with wildcards do not try to expand to filenames.
Using [[, == and != interpret strings to the right as shell glob patterns to be matched against the value to the left, for instance: [[ "value" == val* ]].
