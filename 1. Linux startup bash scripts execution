Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with `--login'
Interactive means you can enter commands. The shell is not running because a script has been activated. A login shell means that you got the shell after authenticating to the system, usually by giving your user name and password.
Files read:
• /etc/profile
• ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile: first existing readable file is read
• ~/.bash_logout upon logout.

Invoked as an interactive non-login shell
A non-login shell means that you did not have to authenticate to the system. For instance, when you open a terminal using an icon, or a menu item, that is a non-login shell.
Files read:
• ~/.bashrc
This file is usually referred to in ~/.bash_profile:
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
