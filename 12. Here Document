The here document provides a way of instructing the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only the search string is found (no trailing blanks). All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.

The result is that you don't need to call on separate files; you can use shell-special characters, and it looks
nicer than a bunch of echo's

Example 1:
# Start here document
cat << BROWSERS
mozilla
links
lynx
konqueror
opera
netscape
BROWSERS
# End here document
echo -n "Which is your favorite? "
read browser
echo "Starting $browser, please wait..."
$browser &

Example 2: 
# To automatically install package
# $1 param is package name
yum install $1 << CONFIRM
y
CONFIRM
