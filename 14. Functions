Functions either use the syntax

function FUNCTION { COMMANDS; }
or
FUNCTION () { COMMANDS; }

These commands are executed whenever FUNCTION is specified as the name of a command. The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.

Common mistakes-
1. The curly braces must be separated from the body by spaces, otherwise they are interpreted in the wrong way.
2. The body of a function should end in a semicolon or a newline.
